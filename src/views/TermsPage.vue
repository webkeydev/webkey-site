            <p>
              We are committed to only collecting the information necessary to provide and improve our Services. When we do collect your information, we store it and associate it with your account unless otherwise noted. We take your privacy very seriously and will only use and disclose this information as described in this Webkey Privacy Policy. Generally, you can browse through our Website(s) without providing us with any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, as you navigate through our Website(s) and/or use our Services, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (server logs, clickstream). Your internet browser automatically transmits some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer or mobile device is currently using; the date and time you access our Website or use our Services and the pages that you access while at the Website. Should any of that these data or a combination thereof become relatable to you as an identified or identifiable person and thus (or otherwise) qualify as personal data under the Data Directive or other applicable regulations at any point in time, it shall automatically be considered as personal data and will be handled by Webkey accordingly without further notification. This information is used by us for internal business purposes, to analyse trends and to improve upon our Website, products and Services. Other anonymous information may be collected from your computer or mobile device through tracking technologies that we employ on our Websites such as cookies, unique IDs and internet tags or web beacons.

            <h2>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
            <p>
              Webkey uses cookies to help us track and analyse user traffic patterns. A "Cookie" is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. A cookie file can contain information such as a unique user ID that a website uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you elect to supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. Cookies can help save you time, for example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie recalls your specific information for future visits. In addition to cookies, our Website(s) use a variety of other methods and tools for tracking purposes, including Internet tags and web beacons, which are small pieces of data that are embedded in images and pages of our Websites. While most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers allow you to modify your browser setting to decline cookies and/or "opt-out" of tracking technologies. Please note however, if a visitor turns off cookies such visitor may find some of the functionality of our website and/or our services and Apps, to be reduced or impaired. We also utilize both proprietary and third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to gather information designed to help us gain insight into how visitors interact with and use our Websites and Services. You can prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics on our Websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, which is available here. We may also use certain Google Analytics Advertising features which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to our Websites or other websites. You can manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads through Google's Ad Settings here.

            <p>
              Your personal information is protected for your privacy and security. Webkey safeguards the security and confidentiality of the data you send us with physical, technical, and managerial procedures. While using our Services, Webkey only uses forms of secure communication (HTTPS, SSL or more secure) between Webkey servers and your device. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, take advantage of multi-factor authentication features where available and make sure you use an up-to-date and secure browser. To use our application as part of our Services you need to provide our application with "root" access rights. Webkey will use such rights securely and only in order to facilitate providing the Services, especially no spying-, monitoring software or malware will be installed. Root access rights will solely and in a secure way be used to perform or allow us to perform the actions required to perform the Services. For the functioning of our application and Services, further access rights could be required to be granted by you on your device, which will separately be requested and by Google Market or other platforms upon installing our application or accessing our Services.
