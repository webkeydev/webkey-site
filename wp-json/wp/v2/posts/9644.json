We have worked on improving the quality and lag time of the screen mirror (and the screen stream) recently. With Webkey you only need a stable connection to have a full view of your Android device\u2019s screen, running smoothly in real time. No rooted devices are required for this feature.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We offer the screen mirroring feature as part of our standard app. You may also combine the screen mirroring feature with other Webkey features such as the remote screenshot or screen recording.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can I use the screen mirroring feature for?<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the most important features of our app. It is the simplest way we can provide to check the controlled phone\u2019s screen remotely. But you can also think about a tablet for example with a broken screen: in this case the screen mirror feature will give you back the visibility of what you stored on your tablet, thus allowing you to continue to use it or save files etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/webkeyapp.com\/en\/business\/\">In the business environment<\/a>, this feature is the basis of providing remote support as it allows you to centrally monitor the connected devices and what is on their screens, all in real time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You may also find important notes about the Legacy Screen Stream setting in this <a href=\"https:\/\/webkeyapp.com\/en\/legacy-screen-stream\/\">article.<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] Screen mirroring explained simply Screen mirroring is duplicating the screen of a mobile, tablet or laptop on a different screen.
