A &#8220;Cookie&#8221; is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. A cookie file can contain information such as a unique user ID that a website uses to track the pages you&#8217;ve visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you elect to supply yourself. A cookie can&#8217;t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. Cookies can help save you time, for example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie recalls your specific information for future visits. In addition to cookies, our Website(s) use a variety of other methods and tools for tracking purposes, including Internet tags and web beacons, which are small pieces of data that are embedded in images and pages of our Websites. While most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers allow you to modify your browser setting to decline cookies and\/or &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of tracking technologies. Please note however, if a visitor turns off cookies such visitor may find some of the functionality of our website and\/or our services and Apps, to be reduced or impaired.

You can prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics on our Websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, which is available here. We may also use certain Google Analytics Advertising features which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to our Websites or other websites. You can manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads through Google&#8217;s Ad Settings here.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title--general title--4\" data-v-78d519ae=\"\">HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED<\/h2>\n<p data-v-78d519ae=\"\">Webkey uses the information we collect for our own general business purposes, which may include:\u00a0<br data-v-78d519ae=\"\" \/>&#8211; to help us analyse, research, report on and improve upon the Services we provide;\u00a0<br data-v-78d519ae=\"\" \/>&#8211; to fulfil your requests and\/or orders for certain products, services and support;\u00a0<br data-v-78d519ae=\"\" \/>&#8211; to market our Services, or the services of our third party business partners, to you and keep you up to date on our latest product updates, announcements, and special offers.
